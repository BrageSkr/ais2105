# Lab Assignment 2: Workspaces and Moving Robots
The purpose of this lab assignment is to learn how to set up a robot workspace and have the robot move around in them. This will specifically be that you create a URDF which defines the workarea around the robot, and then you will connect to a physical robot to see what happens.

## Task 1: Understanding URDF
Every robot in ROS2 is described using URDF (Universal Robot Description Format). It is XML based and describes each `link` and `joint`, where a link is a part of the robot (such as the shoulder, wrist, etc), while the joint is the joint between two links.

## Task 2: Creating a table

## Task 3: Connecting to the robot
